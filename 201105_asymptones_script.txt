Stage begins empty. When we decide to start the concert:
***

Steve and Lisa walk on stage holding controllers and frantically mashing the buttons and joysticks.
[The rest of the group begins to trickle in from both sides, each singer coming on stage whenever they feel like it.]
They stare intently at an imaginary TV screen in front of them, occasionally making noises:

Lisa: HA!!
Steve: oof.
[Two of the ROBOTS enter stage right at this point, placing the "APPLIED CRYOGENICS" sign on a table.]
Lisa: aaand BOOM goes the dynamite!
Steve: oh, shit!
[The ROBOTS return to the group from the table. By this point everyone except Steve should be in concert formation.]
Steve: GOTCHA!
[Steve and Lisa immediately stop mashing buttons. Steve returns to concert formation as the group begins to sing "Up-B".]

* Up-B

[At the very end of Up-B, Steve comes back around to the front.
 After the last line, Lisa swings an imaginary Home Run Bat as someone (JB) makes the corresponding noise.
 Steve then staggers backwards into the Applied Cryonics table and "freezes," as the CHORUS EXITS STAGE LEFT.
 Lisa then runs over shouting "Steve, are you OK?" then "trips" and falls onto the table and "freezes."
 A member of the chorus picks up and holds aloft the "12 Years Later" sign. Then the CHORUS WALKS FROM BACKSTAGE LEFT TO BACKSTAGE RIGHT, MAKING LASER/EXPLOSION NOISES/GESTURES.
 Unit 0042 and Unit 0043 stay behind...]

Unit 0042: I sure am happy about all the changes that have taken place in the last -- 12 years.
[A member of the chorus picks up the "ERTURE SCIENCE" sign and lines it up with the "APPLIED CRYOGENICS" sign to spell "APERTURE SCIENCE"]
Unit 0043: Which changes -- specifically -- are you referring -- to?
Unit 0042: Mostly how we -- killed all humans.
CHORUS: *gasp!!!*
Unit 0042: Well except that to test our portal guns we kept a few around
CHORUS: Phew!! [rubbing forheads]
Unit 0042: Allow me to -- explain

[At this point Steve and Lisa "unfreeze" and run over to join the chorus before the next song.]

* The Humans Are Dead (Robots)

[Steve and Lisa wander over to the table and read the new sign.]
Lisa: Aperture Science? What does that even mean?
GLaDOS: Hello and welcome. We hope your brief detention has been a pleasant one. [Takes game controllers and replaces them with portal guns.] You are in now in possession of the Aperture Science hand-held portal device. The test will now begin.
[GLaDOS disappears to backstage right]
Steve: What do we do with these things? [Raises gun to shoot]
Lisa: No!!! Stop!! That's a *gun*, it's dangerous! We have to put these down and get out of here!
Steve: And how the hell are we going to do that?! You heard what she said! This is some kinda test that we have to pass before we can leave, and we have to use these-- whatever they are to do it!
[Steve begins to walk back over to stage center, in front of the waiting chorus]
Steve: [exhale] Listen, I'm sorry. We've got to put our differences behind us and work together to solve these puzzles.
