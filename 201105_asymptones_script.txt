Two people (guy and girl) are playing super smash brothers near a cryogenic testing facility

* Up-B

All of the sudden, explosions start happening outside, and the two people fall into the cryogenic tubes (for 12 years)

... Twelve years later ...

Two robots (turrets or other in portal) are discussing how they killed all the humans in the robot uprising in the late 90's, saving only a few to test their portal guns

* The Humans Are Dead (Robots)

The two humans awake from their cryogenic tubes to find that the cryogenic testing facility has become an aperture science testing facility. The two people are trying to find their way out of the portal rooms, and getting upset at each other over disagreements how to solve the puzzle.  Then, one of these two people points out that they had better cooperate, since there are only two of them.

* Finite Simple Group

They discover the robots and fight them.

* Ultimate Showdown

Meanwhile, the two defeated robots are being rebuilt by an army of other robots + GLaDOS

* Build Me Up Buttercup

Newly refurbished, the robots + glados are quite happy to be still alive

* Still Alive

Meanwhile, the two humans have managed to escape and find sweet sweet sky.

* Double Rainbow

Watching the two as they leave the portal factory, the robots notice the plot-required romantic spark growing between the two people.

* Can You Feel The Love Tonight?

Confused at the concept of love, the two robots search the databases to try to find a formula that explains what love is

* Title of the Song

Glados and the turrets show up at the end for an EPIC FINALE!!!

* Bohemian Rhapsody
