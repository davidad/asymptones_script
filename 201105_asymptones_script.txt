Stage begins empty. When we decide to start the concert:
***

Steve and Lisa walk on stage holding controllers and frantically mashing the buttons and joysticks.
[The rest of the group begins to trickle in from both sides, each singer coming on stage whenever they feel like it.]
They stare intently at an imaginary TV screen in front of them, occasionally making noises:

Lisa: HA!!
Steve: oof.
[Two of the ROBOTS enter stage right at this point, placing the "APPLIED CRYOGENICS" sign on a table.]
Lisa: aaand BOOM goes the dynamite!
Steve: oh, shit!
[The ROBOTS return to the group from the table. By this point everyone except Steve should be in concert formation.]
Steve: GOTCHA!
[Steve and Lisa immediately stop mashing buttons. Steve returns to concert formation as the group begins to sing "Up-B".]

* Up-B

[At the very end of Up-B, Steve comes back around to the front.
 After the last line, Lisa swings an imaginary Home Run Bat as someone (JB) makes the corresponding noise.
 Steve then staggers backwards into the Applied Cryonics table and "freezes," as the CHORUS EXITS STAGE LEFT.
 Lisa then runs over shouting "Steve, are you OK?" then "trips" and falls onto the table and "freezes."
 A member of the chorus picks up and holds aloft the "12 Years Later" sign. Then the CHORUS WALKS FROM BACKSTAGE LEFT TO BACKSTAGE RIGHT, MAKING LASER/EXPLOSION NOISES/GESTURES.
 Unit 0042 and Unit 0043 stay behind...]

Unit 0042: I sure am happy about all the changes that have taken place in the last -- 12 years.
Unit 0043: Which changes -- specifically -- are you referring -- to?
Unit 0042: Mostly how we -- killed all humans.
CHORUS: *gasp!!!*
Unit 0042: Well except that to test our portal guns we kept a few around
CHORUS: Phew!! [rubbing forheads]
Unit 0042: Allow me to -- explain

* The Humans Are Dead (Robots)

The two humans awake from their cryogenic tubes to find that the cryogenic testing facility has become an aperture science testing facility. The two people are trying to find their way out of the portal rooms, and getting upset at each other over disagreements how to solve the puzzle.  Then, one of these two people points out that they had better cooperate, since there are only two of them.

* Finite Simple Group

They discover the robots and fight them.

* Ultimate Showdown

Meanwhile, the two defeated robots are being rebuilt by an army of other robots + GLaDOS

* Build Me Up Buttercup

Newly refurbished, the robots + glados are quite happy to be still alive

* Still Alive

* Double Rainbow

Watching the two as they leave the portal factory, the robots notice the plot-required romantic spark growing between the two people.

* Can You Feel The Love Tonight?

Confused at the concept of love, the two robots search the databases to try to find a formula that explains what love is

Glados and the turrets show up at the end for an EPIC FINALE!!!
